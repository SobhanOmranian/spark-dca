/**
 * An INSERT INTO statement, as parsed from SQL.
 *
 * @param table                the logical plan representing the table.
 * @param query                the logical plan representing data to write to.
 * @param overwrite            overwrite existing table or partitions.
 * @param partitionSpec        a map from the partition key to the partition value (optional).
 *                             If the value is missing, dynamic partition insert will be performed.
 *                             As an example, `INSERT INTO tbl PARTITION (a=1, b=2) AS` would have
 *                             Map('a' -> Some('1'), 'b' -> Some('2')),
 *                             and `INSERT INTO tbl PARTITION (a=1, b) AS ...`
 *                             would have Map('a' -> Some('1'), 'b' -> None).
 * @param ifPartitionNotExists If true, only write if the partition does not exist.
 *                             Only valid for static partitions.
