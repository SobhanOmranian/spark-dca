# Experiment "I/O Variability"

# Overview
The aim of this experiment is measuring the variability of IO I/O performance between the nodes of a cluster.

# Tools
The `dd` command was uses to read or write the data. The bash interal variable `$SECONDS` was used to measure the time.

# Scripts
#### `run.sh`
On each iteration, the script issues a SSH into a node (nodes 301-347), first writes a file, and then reads the same file, measuring the time for both operations. Note that the buffer cache is cleared after each operation.

#### Output
The output is a comma-separated file `result.csv` in the directory `$RESULT_HOME/resultIoVariability.csv` which can be used by the plot the experiment.

=================================================================

#### `plot_io_benchmark.py`
plots the final figure, based on the data file generated by  `run.sh` script.

#### Arguments
* --inputFile, -i: Absolute path of the file generated by the `run.sh` script.
* --outputFile, -o: Absolute path of the output pdf file containing the figure.


# Requirements
* Before every read and right, one should make sure the OS buffer cache is cleared, so that all the I/O requests actually reach the disk rather than memory. The script responsible for this is `../common/terasort/clear_buffer_cache.sh`. Since this operation requires sudo access, the user must replace this line with their own script which flushes the buffer cache.
