# Experiment "Thread Selection"

# Overview
The aim of this figure is seeing how the dynamic solution selects (potentially) different number of threads for each executor in every stage of execution.

# Tools
The related data is written out by the spark executor itself when the dynamic solution is enabled. The related data for each executor can be found in: `$RESULT_HOME`/`appName`#`executorId`.dca which is then combined to `$RESULT_HOME/combined.dca` to have a single file with the data for all the executors and stages.

# Scripts
#### `../dca/combine.sh`
Combines the individual `.dca` files of each executor into a single file which holds the data for all the executors and stages. This script is called in `../common/spark/run_dynamic.pl` once an application is finished.

=================================================================

#### `plot_dca_thread_selection.py`
plots the final figure, based on the data file generated by  the `../dca/combine.sh` script.

#### Arguments
* --inputFile, -i: Absolute path of the file generated by the `../dca/combine.sh` script.
* --outputFile, -o: Absolute path of the directory where the output pdf file will be saved.
